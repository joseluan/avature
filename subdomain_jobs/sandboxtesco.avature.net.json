Customers want great products at great value which they can buy easily and it's our job to deliver this in the right way for them.

We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. Across the Tesco group we are building an inclusive workplace, a place to actively celebrate the cultures, personalities and preferences of our colleagues \u2013 who in turn help to build the success of our business and reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working.

            "About us": "Our vision at Tesco is to become every customer\u2019s favourite way to shop, whether they are at home or out on the move. \u00a0Our core purpose is \u201cServing our customers, communities and planet a little better every day\u201d. \u00a0Serving means more than a transactional relationship with our customers. \u00a0It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all stakeholders, for the communities we are part of, and for the planet. Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support. Tesco is committed to celebrating diversity and everyone is welcome at Tesco. We're committed to providing a fully inclusive recruitment process, allowing candidates the opportunity to thrive and inform us of any reasonable adjustments they may require.

            "About us": "Our vision at Tesco is to become every customer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s favourite way to shop, whether they are at home or out on the move. \u00c2\u00a0Our core purpose is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Serving our customers, communities and planet a little better every day\u00e2\u20ac. \u00c2\u00a0Serving means more than a transactional relationship with our customers. \u00c2\u00a0It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all stakeholders, for the communities we are part of, and for the planet. Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. \u00c2 We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00c3\u00a1s Na h\u00c3\u2030ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00c2\u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00c2\u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support. Tesco is committed to celebrating diversity and everyone is welcome at Tesco. We're committed to providing a fully inclusive recruitment process, allowing candidates the opportunity to thrive and inform us of any reasonable adjustments they may require. For further information on the accessibility support we can offer, please click http://roi.tesco-careers.com/accessibility/ How can I let Tesco know I need additional support?

Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else.

            "About us": "Our vision at Tesco is to become every customer\u2019s favourite way to shop, whether they are at home or out on the move. \u00a0Our core purpose is \u201cServing our customers, communities and planet a little better every day\u201d. \u00a0Serving means more than a transactional relationship with our customers. \u00a0It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all stakeholders, for the communities we are part of, and for the planet. Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support. Tesco is committed to celebrating diversity and everyone is welcome at Tesco. We're committed to providing a fully inclusive recruitment process, allowing candidates the opportunity to thrive and inform us of any reasonable adjustments they may require.

            "About us": "Our vision at Tesco is to become every customer\u2019s favourite way to shop, whether they are at home or out on the move. \u00a0Our core purpose is \u201cServing our customers, communities and planet a little better every day\u201d. \u00a0Serving means more than a transactional relationship with our customers. \u00a0It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all stakeholders, for the communities we are part of, and for the planet. Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 163 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support. Everyone is welcome at Tesco. We have embraced a blended working week \u2013 combining office and remote working. Our offices will continue to be where we connect, collaborate and innovate. Please talk to us to about how this can work for you."

Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. \u00c2 We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00c3\u00a1s Na h\u00c3\u2030ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00c2\u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00c2\u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working.

Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else.

            "About us": "Our vision at Tesco is to become every customer\u2019s favourite way to shop, whether they are at home or out on the move. \u00a0Our core purpose is \u201cServing our customers, communities and planet a little better every day\u201d. \u00a0Serving means more than a transactional relationship with our customers. \u00a0It means acting as a responsible and sustainable business for all stakeholders, for the communities we are part of, and for the planet. Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves. It is embedded in our values: we treat people how they want to be treated. \u00a0 At Tesco, we not only celebrate diversity, but recognise the value and opportunity it brings. \u00a0We always want our colleagues to feel they can be themselves at work and we are committed to helping them be at their best. We know life looks a little different for each of us. That\u2019s why at Tesco, we always welcome chats about flexible working. Some people are at the start of their careers, some want the freedom to do the things they love. Others are going through life-changing moments like becoming a carer, nearing retirement, adapting to parenthood, or something else. So, talk to us throughout your application about how we can support. Tesco is committed to celebrating diversity and everyone is welcome at Tesco. We're committed to providing a fully inclusive recruitment process, allowing candidates the opportunity to thrive and inform us of any reasonable adjustments they may require.

Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards.

Through initiatives like the Tesco Community Fund, our association with Children\u2019s Health Foundation, our partnership with FoodCloud and our Stronger Starts programme, we have supported over 21,000 community groups, raised over \u20ac7.5 million for medical equipment, and provided almost 15 million meals nationwide, to those living in food insecurity. Tesco has operated in the Irish retail market since 1997, and with 170 stores nationwide, we employ over 13,000 people in cities and towns around Ireland, supporting almost 45,000 jobs directly and indirectly. We partner with over 500 Irish suppliers - of which almost three-quarters are small and medium enterprises - which in turn supports almost 13,000 farming families around Ireland. Tesco is the single largest buyer of Irish food and drink in the world, buying \u20ac1.6 Billion a year; more than any other single country in the European Union, more than even the USA which you perceive as a massive buyer of Irish food. We work closely with suppliers across Ireland who are dedicated to making the best products for our customers and this is reflected in the numerous awards our products have won over the years including Bl\u00e1s Na h\u00c9ireann, World Steak Challenge and Great Taste Awards. We are proud to have an inclusive culture at Tesco where everyone truly feels able to be themselves.
