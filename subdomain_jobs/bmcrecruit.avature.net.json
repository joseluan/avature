environments.\n\u2022\tEngineering Practices \u2013 Contribute to pragmatic engineering standards across the full stack, including CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, code quality practices, and DevOps methodologies suitable for a fast-moving, early-stage product team.\n\u2022\tProduct Collaboration \u2013 Partner closely with product management, designers, and stakeholders to translate product requirements into end-to-end working software, provide implementation feedback, and support rapid learning from customer feedback.\n\u2022\tOwnership & Execution \u2013 Take end-to-end ownership of features and subsystems across frontend and backend, proactively identifying gaps, resolving complex technical challenges, and driving work forward even when requirements are incomplete or evolving.\nTo ensure you\u2019re set up for success, you will bring the following skillset & experience:\n\u2022\n10+ years of professional software development experience, including building and

Hands-on experience with Microservices, Spring, REST APIs, Swagger, and modern frontend frameworks.\n\u2022 Strong system design skills, with the ability to balance short-term delivery needs and long-term platform evolution.\n\u2022 Experience with containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes, along with CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices.\n\u2022 Experience working with public cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, or GCP).\n\u2022 Exposure to data platforms and data products, including areas such as data orchestration, data management, lineage, observability, or governance.\n\u2022 Familiarity with a broad range of data technologies, including relational databases, cloud data warehouses, data transformation frameworks, and object storage.\n\u2022 Comfortable operating in ambiguous, fast-evolving environments, with the ability to lead through execution.\n\u2022 Strong understanding of web development best practices, including performance optimization,
